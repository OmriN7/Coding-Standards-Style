# my personal coding standards and style
Hi! This is my personal coding standards and style when I make my own wbesites. I made this repository for the sake of documentation, to get myself to think about what my style & code, and to hopefully give other developers some ideas.

I ~~stole~~ got the idea from [thelifemgmt](https://github.com/thelifemgmt)'s [Coding Standards & Styleguide](https://github.com/thelifemgmt/coding_standards "thelifemgmt's Coding Standards & Styleguide")
